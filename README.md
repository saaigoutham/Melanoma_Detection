# Melanoma Detection
> Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis. To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma.

## General Information
Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis. To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma.


## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- colab
- keras
- Tensorflow
- glob


## Conclusions
Class rebalance helps in reducing overfititng of the data and increased the accuracy as well
Training Accuracy = 91.47 %
Validation Accuracy - 85.00 %
- Model 1 --> Without Dropout and augmentation which created data to overfit at high ratio
- Model 2 --> With Dropout and Augmentation which reduced overfitting but Accuracy dropped drastically
- Model 3 --> With Batch Normalization and Augumentation which provided good results and better accuracy when compared to other models
